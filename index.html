        <p id="explain">Within the camp, the internees have to deal with the harsh condition of the camp. This include poor housing and food, lack of privacy, limited medical care, and low-quality education. A sense of hopelessness and inferior emerged under the authority
            of the camp. Tension increase when the U.S. government gave the internees royalty questionnaires.</p>
        <p id="explain">The oldest internees, Issei, were community leader who were arrested after the bombing of Pearl Harbor and labeled as enemy aliens. They experienced intense stress from the abandonment of home, separation from friends and family. Some found that
            their children can no longer recognize them and some were denounced by the arrest and saw as a spy. Under the oppression of the camp and women were pay as much as men, male Issei feel powerless and lack a sense of a figure in family. Their
            children frequently ate with peers instead of families in the mass hall.</p>

        <h3 id="subtitle">Psychological Impact after Interment</h3>
        <p id="explain">Issei suffered the most after the Internment end because they were too old to start a new career. Nearly all of the Nisei never mentioned their experience at the camp, which a symptom of posttraumatic stress. Some have distant themselves from
            Japanese culture or anything that related to Japan. In contrast, some developed a distrust in white American and associated only with Japanese-Americans.</p>
        <p id="explain">Nonetheless, the Nisei remained a low profile and fitted into American culture. This psychological defense impacted their children, Sansei. Sansei grew up hearing the internment from their parents.They experienced their parent’s unwillingness
            to discuss the internment and sensed that what happened was too painful to be discussed. The Sansei were also affected by their parents’ effort to blend into American culture and minimize anything related to Japan. As a result, they lost a
            sense of their own culture and language.</p>
